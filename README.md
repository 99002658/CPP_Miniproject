The problem is coming up with a way so that no customer starves, i.e., every single one of them can continue to eat and alternatively sing. Here, we assume that no customer can get to know when the other customer may want to eat or sing.

*This problem is a variation of the Dining Philosophers Problem, one of the most famous computing problems. The goal is to come up with a way to feed everyone without creating a deadlock situation.*
